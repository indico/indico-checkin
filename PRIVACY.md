# Privacy Policy

This application doesn't store by itself any data anywhere other than your phone. No tracking or ads are included and
no user information is collected, sent, or processed in any central database. Configuration information is stored
locally, on your phone.

## Data sent to Indico Servers

Once you pair the application with an Indico event, you will be establishing a link with the server where it lives.
Once you start checking in users, the application may share the following basic information with the target server:
 * The event's unique ID;
 * The user's unique Registration ID at the event in question;
 * A unique, random, secret code generated along with the ticket and which is used to prove its authenticity;
 * The user's "checked-in" status ("yes" or "no").

If you would like to know how this data is collected and processed on the target server, please refer to its own
Privacy Policy.
